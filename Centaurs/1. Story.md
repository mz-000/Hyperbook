**Leon, June 1998**

The world's first championship of advanced chess organized by Kasparov.

In advanced (alt: _freestyle_ or _centaur_) chess, humans of any expert level play assisted by technology such as hardware, software and databases.

Over the following year, a community of advanced chess players develops, designing various approaches of combining intelligence for chess playing mastery.

Having evolved their methods, centaur players regularly start out-playing both chess grandmasters and supercomputers in 2005.
