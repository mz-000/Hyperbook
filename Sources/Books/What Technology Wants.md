## Highlights
- We tend to isolate manufactured technology from nature, even to the point of thinking of it as antinature, only because it has grown to rival the impact and power of its home. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=346))
- The first simple stone tools appeared in the same archaeological moment that the brains of the hominins (humanish apes) who made them began to enlarge toward their current size. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=351))
- As Sapiens expanded in range, they remade animal horns and tusks into thrusters and knives, cleverly turning the animals’ own weapons against them. They sculpted figurines, the first art, and the first jewelry, beads cut from shells, at this threshold 50,000 years ago. While humans had long used fire, the first hearths and shelter structures were invented about this time. Trade of scarce shells, chert, and flint rock began. At approximately the same time Sapiens invented fishing hooks and nets and needles for sewing hides into clothes.

- But the chief advantage of language is not communication but autogeneration. Language is a trick that allows the mind to question itself; a magic mirror that reveals to the mind what the mind thinks; a handle that turns a mind into a tool. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=418))
- Grandparents are the conduits of culture, and without them culture stagnates. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=517))
- It is no coincidence that increased longevity is the most measurable consequence of the acquisition of technology. It is also the most consequential. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=534))
- Technology has domesticated us. As fast as we remake our tools, we remake ourselves. We are coevolving with our technology, and so we have become deeply dependent on it. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=589))
- If all technology—every last knife and spear—were to be removed from this planet, our species would not last more than a few months. We are now symbiotic with technology. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=590))
- When Sapiens gained control of fire, this powerful technology further modified the natural terrain on a massive scale. Such a tiny trick—burning grasslands, controlling it with backfires, and summoning flames to cook grains—disrupted vast regions of the continents. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=597))
- One breakthrough invention, such as the alphabet, the steam pump, or electricity, can lead to further breakthrough inventions, such as books, coal mines, and telephones. These advances in turn led to other breakthrough inventions, such as libraries, power generators, and the internet. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=608))
- Progress, even moral progress, is ultimately a human invention. It is a useful product of our wills and minds, and thus it is a technology. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=623))
- We can decide slavery is not a good idea. We can decide that fairly applied laws, rather than nepotistic favoritism, is a good idea. We can outlaw certain punishments with treaties. We can encourage accountability with the invention of writing. We can consciously expand our circle of empathy. These are all inventions, products of our minds, as much as lightbulbs and telegraphs are. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=624))
- In White’s view, the adoption of the lowly foot stirrup for horse saddles enabled riders to use weapons on horseback, which gave an advantage to the cavalry over infantry and to the lords who could afford horses, and so nurtured the rise of aristocratic feudalism in Europe. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=631))
- Therefore a nest or a hive can best be considered a body built rather than grown. A shelter is animal technology, the animal extended. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=676))
- If technology is an extension of humans, it is not an extension of our genes but of our minds. Technology is therefore the extended body for ideas. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=683))
- The data fills volumes. Hundreds of scholarly papers record substantial improvements across the board in matters we care about. The trajectories of these measurements generally point in the same direction: up. Their accumulated weight elicited this famous prediction by Julian Simon a decade ago: ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=1484))
- hidden consequences—self-replicating technologies add two more: amplification and acceleration. ([Location 3919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=3919))
- We need to invent appropriate long-term training technologies to guide them across the generations. The worst thing to do is banish and isolate them. Rather, we want to work with the bullying problem child. High-risk technologies need more chances for us to discover their true strengths. ([Location 3951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=3951))
- Extrapolated, technology wants what life wants: Increasing efficiency Increasing opportunity Increasing emergence Increasing complexity Increasing diversity Increasing specialization Increasing ubiquity Increasing freedom Increasing mutualism Increasing beauty Increasing sentience Increasing structure Increasing evolvability ([Location 4024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4024))
- Our body size is, weirdly, almost exactly in the middle of the size of the universe. The smallest things we know about are approximately 30 orders of magnitude smaller than we are, and the largest structures in the universe are about 30 orders of magnitude bigger. We inhabit a middle scale that is sympathetic to sustainable flexibility in the universe’s current physics. ([Location 4193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4193))
- Diversity, in fact, will produce tools to handle diversity. ([Location 4282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4282))
- The uniformity of a standard writing system (like an alphabet or script) unleashes the unexpected diversity of literature. Without uniform rules, every word has to be made up, so communication is localized, inefficient, and thwarted. ([Location 4289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4289))
- Anthropologist of technology Pierre Lemonnier ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4333))
- People will choose to abstain from or forsake particular global standards of technology as a form of idiosyncratic distinction. In this way while the planetary culture slides toward convergence of technologies, billions of technology users will diverge in their personal choices as they edge toward using smaller and more eccentric selections of available stuff. ([Location 4358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4358))
- We can forecast the future of almost any invention working today by imagining it evolving into dozens of narrow uses. Technology is born in generality and grows to specificity. ([Location 4431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4431))
- One thousand teleportation stations rejuvenate vacation travel. One billion teleportation stations overturn commutes, reimagine globalism, introduce tele-lag sickness, reintroduce the grand spectacle, kill the nation-state, and end privacy. ([Location 4490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043XYMOK&location=4490))
- Some people find this technological symbiosis scary, or even horrifying, but it is not much different from our use of paper and pencil in long division. For most ordinary humans, dividing long numbers without technology is impossible. Our brains are simply not wired to accomplish this naturally. We use the technologies of writing and tricks of arithmetic to divide, multiply, or manipulate large or multiple numbers. We can do it in our heads in a fashion, but only by watching ourselves virtually write the problem out on virtual paper in our mind.
