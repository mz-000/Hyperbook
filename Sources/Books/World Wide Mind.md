## Highlights
- This intense connectivity reveals a longing for fast, dense communication—one that current bodies and devices can only partly fulfill. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=129))
- And people should be able to walk down the street savoring the richness of the world while also being aware, in the background of their minds, of the ceaseless hum of their friends’ ideas and experiences. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=132))
- But what if we built an electronic corpus callosum to bind us together? What if we eliminated the interface problem—the slow keyboards, the sore fingers, the tiny screens, the clumsiness of point-and-click—by directly linking the Internet to the human brain? It would become seamlessly part of us, as natural and simple to use as our own hands. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=173))

- Along the way I debunk common assumptions about “mind reading” fed by science fiction. It will never be possible to experience the world exactly the way another brain does. It will never be possible to achieve perfect, unambiguous communication. It will never be possible to do away with language. What I propose are new kinds of communication, which like every previous kind will present new possibilities and new risks. I also aim to imagine how to sustain the life-affirming properties of human contact and community in the face of ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=229))
- They also surfaced in a New Yorker profile of the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. Paul Churchland mused, Presumably, it will be possible, someday, for two separate brains to be linked artificially … and to exchange thoughts infinitely faster and more clearly than they now can through the muddled, custom-clotted, serially processed medium of speech.

- The dendrite can even detach, eliminating that synapse altogether. When you stop hearing the noisy street outside your window, it’s because the synapses corresponding to that perception have weakened or detached.

- This means that people who look up at the night sky bespangled with stars and say “Suddenly I feel so small” have it all wrong. They are physically smaller than the galaxy, yes. But they have the same number of neurons as a galaxy has stars: 100 billion. (Curious, but true.) ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=1189))
- It has to be simple, Jeff Hawkins argues in his book On Intelligence. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSK6C&location=1246))
