The strength of finance is that it takes a structured approach to decision making, with one key building block underlying all decisions — understanding the value of time, or the Time Value of Money (TVM). In this course, we will develop this building block using introductory, and simple, applications. We will learn about the Time Value of Money (TVM), Simple Future Value (FV) , Simple Present Value (PV) , Future Value of Annuity, Loans, compounding, and Valuing Perpetuities. We will introduce the framework in a carefully structured and replicable way to prepare you to explore more advanced applications in the rest of the specialization. In the follow-on courses, we will expand the applications to more complex real-world decisions.

After completing this course, you will have an understanding of how the value of money changes over time. You will understand the implications of all your financial decisions, including saving for the future through different channels and borrowing for future needs. You will leave with the practical knowledge needed to make informed decisions on a wide range of financial decisions. This course is part of the four-course Foundational Finance for Strategic Decision Making Specialization.

Brian Arthur is known for 3 main sets of ideas:

[Increasing returns.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/increasingreturns.htm) In the 1980s Arthur developed a way for economics to understand how increasing returns or positive feedbacks (e.g. network effects) operate in the economy — in particular how they can magnify small, random events and act to lock in dominant players. This work has gone on to become important to our [understanding of the high-tech economy.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3064681/most-important-economic-theory-in-technology-brian-arthur)

[Complexity economics.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/complexityeconomics.htm) In the late 1980s, Arthur led a group at the Santa Fe Institute to develop an alternative approach to economics—"complexity economics." Standard economics is based on the idea of super-rational actors operating in a static equilibrium world; complexity economics assumes actors in the economy do not necessarily face well-defined problems or use super-rationality. They explore, try to make sense, react and re-react to the outcomes they together create. The economy is not in stasis but always forming, always "discovering" fresh novelty. In this non-equilibrium view of the economy, bubbles and crashes can happen, markets can be "gamed" or exploited, and history and institutions matter.

[How technology evolves.](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/thenatureoftechnology.htm) In 2009, Arthur published _The Nature of Technology: What it Is and How it Evolves._ The book is a theory of evolution for technology. It argues that technology, like biological life, evolves from earlier forms. But the main mechanism isn't Darwin's, it is the combining of earlier technologies—earlier forms—to make new technologies. The book explores in detail how this evolution works. And it argues that economy isn't just a container for its technologies; the economy emerges from its technologies.
